# Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) Attack Playbook

## 1. Objective
This playbook provides a structured response to Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks, where adversaries use a distributed network of compromised devices to overwhelm and disrupt services. The playbook outlines detection, investigation, containment, and remediation steps.

---

## 2. Scope
Applicable to all DDoS attack scenarios, including:
- **Volumetric Attacks** (e.g., UDP flood, ICMP flood, DNS amplification)
- **Protocol-Based Attacks** (e.g., SYN flood, TCP state exhaustion, Smurf attack)
- **Application Layer Attacks** (e.g., HTTP flood, Slowloris attack, API abuse)
- **Botnet-Driven Attacks** (e.g., IoT botnets, malware-driven DDoS campaigns)

---

## 3. Detection Methods
### **Network Monitoring**
- Unusual spikes in inbound traffic volume.
- Increased network latency or connection timeouts.
- Large number of requests from different geographical locations.

### **Application & Server Logs**
- Increased number of requests to a specific endpoint.
- Multiple failed login attempts or session timeouts.
- Web server logs showing a high rate of identical requests.

### **Threat Intelligence Feeds**
- Reports of active botnet activities targeting your infrastructure.
- Indicators of attack traffic matching known DDoS patterns.

## 4. Investigation & Containment
### **Identify Attack Characteristics**
1. Determine the attack type (volumetric, protocol, or application layer).
2. Identify source IP addresses, user agents, and attack vectors.
3. Verify whether the attack is targeting a specific application or infrastructure component.

### **Containment Steps**
1. **Rate Limiting & Traffic Filtering**: Apply rate limits on affected endpoints.
2. **Geo-Blocking & Blacklisting**: Block malicious IPs and untrusted geographic locations.
3. **Enable DDoS Protection Services**: Activate cloud-based or on-premise DDoS protection tools.
4. **Traffic Diversion**: Redirect traffic through a Content Delivery Network (CDN) or scrubbing center.

---

## 5. Remediation & Mitigation
### **Technical Controls**
- Deploy Web Application Firewalls (WAF) to filter malicious requests.
- Implement SYN cookies and TCP hardening to prevent protocol abuse.
- Use DNS-based rate limiting to mitigate amplification attacks.
- Enable network-level DDoS protection (e.g., AWS Shield, Cloudflare, Akamai, Arbor Networks).

### **User Awareness & Training**
- Train IT and security teams on DDoS identification and response.
- Encourage end-users to report performance degradation and anomalies.

### **Process Improvements**
- Regularly update firewall and IDS/IPS rules to detect new attack patterns.
- Conduct periodic stress testing to measure infrastructure resilience.
- Establish relationships with ISPs and DDoS mitigation service providers.

---

## 6. Escalation & Reporting
- Escalate confirmed DDoS attacks to the Security Operations Center (SOC) and IT operations teams.
- Notify affected business units and stakeholders about service disruptions.
- Contact ISPs for traffic filtering assistance if needed.
- Report large-scale attacks to regulatory authorities or industry groups if necessary.
